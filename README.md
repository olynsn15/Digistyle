# DIGISTYLE
Digistyle is a digital archive documenting digital camera models from the 2000s, which have recently regained popularity among young people. With unique designs, distinctive colors, and characteristic photo results, each camera in the DIGISTYLE archive represents the photography style of that era. This project is only the landing page of Digistyle, as stated in the final project's case requirements.
